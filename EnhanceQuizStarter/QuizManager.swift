// This acts as both quiz and quizmanager (in my mental model.) Holds properties and has methods.

import AudioToolbox // This is for SystemSoundID. Does it need to be in here or should it be in the ViewController (for use by VC or quiz manager)? Asked in Slack but no response yet. I commented it out in ViewController and the app seems to work, so i'll leave it that way for now.
