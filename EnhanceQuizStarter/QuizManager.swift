//I think I can move most a BUNCH of the quiz parameters from ViewDidLoad into here (questions asked, questions per round, correct answers, the mechanism for picking a random number that is used as an index to get a question from the TriviaCollection object. EDIT, maybe quiz parameters go in Quiz object, but the mechanics go here (picking, checking, etc.)
