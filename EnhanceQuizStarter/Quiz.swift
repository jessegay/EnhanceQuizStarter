/* I'm not sure I need a separate quiz object. The quiz manager can deal with all the aspects, and if it includes
let questionsPerRound = 4
var questionsAsked = 0
var correctQuestions = 0
var indexOfSelectedQuestion = 0

var gameSound: SystemSoundID = 0

then those properties will define the quiz. OTOH, I could have a quiz object, and access the properties via dot notation.
